            <h1>What is Air Pollution?</h1>
            <p>Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful or excessive quantities of substances in the Earth's atmosphere. These substances can be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases, and they originate from a variety of sources. Natural sources include volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and dust storms, while human activities such as industrial production, vehicle emissions, and agricultural practices significantly contribute to air pollution.</p>

            <h1>Why It Matters</h1>
            <p>Air pollution has significant impacts on human health, the environment, and the economy. It is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and can even lead to premature death.</p>  
            <ol>
                <li>
                  <ul>Health issues<br>
                    <li>Respiratory Issues: Exposure to air pollutants can cause and exacerbate conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory infections.</li><br>
                    <li>Cardiovascular Diseases: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants are linked to heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular problems.</li><br>
                    <li>Premature Death: Long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to reduced life expectancy and increased mortality rates.</li><br>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <ul>Environmental Effects<br>
                    <li>Climate Change: Certain air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.</li><br>
                    <li>Ecosystem Damage: Acid rain, formed from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can acidify soils and water bodies, harming plants, animals, and aquatic life.</li><br>
                    <li>Visibility Reduction: Particulate matter and other pollutants can create haze, reducing visibility and impacting the aesthetic and recreational value of natural areas, as seen in the image above.</li><br>

                  <ul>Economic Costs<br>
                    <li>Healthcare Expenses: Increased medical costs due to air pollution-related illnesses.</li><br>
                    <li>Reduced Labor Productivity: Health issues from air pollution can lead to lost workdays and decreased productivity.</li><br>
                    <li>Agricultural Losses: Pollution can damage crops, reducing yields and impacting food security.</li><br>

            <h1>How It's Measured</h1>
            <p>Air pollution is measured using various methods and instruments that detect the presence of pollutants in the air. Here is a table that summarizes common air pollutants and their measurement methods:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Pollutant</th>
                        <th>Measurement Method</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10)</td>
                        <td>Gravimetric Analysis:<br>
                          Air is drawn through a filter that collects particles, which are then weighed to determine their concentration.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Ozone (O3)</td>
                        <td>UV Photometric Analysis:<br>
                          The method relies on the absorption of ultraviolet light by ozone molecules.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)</td>
                        <td>Chemiluminescence:<br>
                        The reaction of nitric oxide with ozone produces light, which is measured to determine the concentration of nitrogen oxides.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</td>
                        <td>Fluorescence:<br>
                        The gas is exposed to ultraviolet light, causing it to emit fluorescence that can be measured.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
